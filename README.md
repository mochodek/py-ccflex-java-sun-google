# Replication package - py-ccflex and Sun's and Google coding conventions

This is a replication package for the paper "Recognizing Lines of Code Violating Company-Specific Coding Guidelines Using Machine Learning - A Method and Its Evaluation" submitted to the Empirical Software Engineering journal.

It contains the results and inputs for the analysis of applying py-ccflex to identify lines violating Sun's and Google's coding conventions in the source code of three Java-based products:
- Eclipse Platform
- Sprint Framework
- Jasper Reports

If you want to quickly proceed to the analysis, please go directly to the [Analysis.ipynb](Analysis.ipynb) notebook.

The repository contains the following contents:
- [./codebase](codebase) - contains the archive with the source code of the Java projects
- [./configs](configs) - contains Checkstyle and CCFlex configurations (for the latter, you will have to modify the paths in the  file [locations.json](./configs/ccflex/locations.json) so they correspond to the locations on your computer)
- [./data](data) - a folder with the files generated by Checkstyle and CCFlex (this is the basis for the analysis)
- [Analysis.ipynb](Analysis.ipynb) - a jupter notebook with the main analysis (you might have to modify some paths, again)
- [Results.ipynb](Results.ipynb) - a jupyter notebook generating tables and figures 
- \<standard\>-\<codbase\>-results.csv - the output files from the analysis (e.g., google-all-results.csv)
